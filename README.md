# Discord scheduled message
Â 
It allows you to send a message in either direct messages or a server text channel.


In order to use it, replace the text in line 26 with your Discord token. ([How to find your Discord token](https://www.howtogeek.com/879956/what-is-a-discord-token-and-how-do-you-get-one/#how-to-get-your-discord-token))<br>
and replace the text in line 27 with the channel ID. (In the discord client, use [this](https://turbofuture.com/internet/Discord-Channel-ID#1-switch-on-discord-developer-mode), and in the web browser, copy the digits at the end of the url.)


After you launch the app, you will be asked to enter the initial message (sent before the delay) and the final message (sent after the delay). Both messages can be omitted, making it seem as if you are typing for the duration of the delay, without sending any messages.
